        <h2 class="h2">I'm a Computer Science major who plans on graduating in December, 2025. I enjoy 
            programming and creating new things along the way
            such as this website. I have experience with HTML, CSS, C++, Python, Javascript, SQL
            and plan on becoming familiar with technologies such as Node.js, React, Angular,
            Bootstrap, and many more. I'm currently searching for an internship where
            I can display my skills and gain experience. I have a couple projects listed
            on this website, mainly done in groups within certain classes I have taken.
