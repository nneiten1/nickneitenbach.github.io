            <h2 class="h2">I'm a Computer Science undergraduate who plans on graduating in
                December, 2025. I enjoy programming and creating new things along the way
                such as this website. I have experience with HTML, CSS, C++, Python, Javascript, SQL
                and plan on becoming familiar with technologies such as Node.js, React, Angular,
                Bootstrap, AWS, and many more. I'm currently searching for an internship where
                I can display my skills and gain experience.
