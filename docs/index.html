            <p class="about"><u>About me</u></p>
            <h2 class="h2">I'm a Computer Science major who plans on graduating in December, 2025. I enjoy 
                programming and creating new things along the way
                such as this website. I have experience with HTML, CSS, C++, Python, Javascript, SQL
                and plan on becoming familiar with technologies such as Node.js, React, Angular,
                Bootstrap, and many more. I'm currently searching for an internship where
                I can display my skills and gain experience. I have a couple projects listed
                on this website, mainly done in groups within certain classes I have taken.
            </h2>
            <p class="h2">My GitHub is also linked below the listed projects which will take you to all of my repositories that include most of my
                class work projects along with other small projects I have done.
            </p>

                target="_blank">Sticky Fingers</a>
            </h4>

            <p class="description">Sticky Fingers is a single or multiplayer game that is based off the game Snake Eyes.
                It consists of a working online and local multiplayer, continuous deployment, controller support, SCRUM workflow,
                and CPU players. I personally worked on the art and CPU players, using logic for the CPU to decide which action to take
                depending on the state of the game.

                target="_blank">Railway Incident Clustering</a></h5>
            <p class="description">This small project was for a Data Mining Techniques class I took. The purpose for this project
                was to preform clustering analysis on a dataset containing railway incident data. It uses several machine learning
                techniques to identify patterns in the data, specifically clustering methods, and evaluate the effectiveness of 
                clustering.

                target="_blank">Capes List</a></h6>
            <p class="description">This was a group project that was developed for our Database System Design class. I mainly worked on 
                the frontend portion of this project and wrote most of the SQL queries by hand before they were implemented into the 
                project. I learned a little bit of PHP with this project. Definitely plan on replacing this project with something else 
                in the near future.
